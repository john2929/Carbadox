Analysis of FigFams annotations

The following files and R script were what was used to analyze the data for the 2017 paper and generate figures for that paper. The input files were generated using established scripts as described in the materials and methods. The script was included here because while it is basically just counting sequences similar to what phyloseq already does, there were a few tweeks (mainly that some ORFs were annotated to multiple functions, but each ORF was only included once within a larger bin of genes) so the code is included here so that the work is transparent.


One input file that is used in the R script:

uniq.spikein.norm.txt 

was too large to be included in this repository. Please send a request to have access to the file.
